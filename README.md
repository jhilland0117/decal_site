# iOSTrials
Smal iOS apps that I created while learning to use xcode and objective-c.

# Running
you will need to use the XCode IDE to run these applications.

# Design
These applications use the MVC design methodology.  To view the source code files (controllers) please enter the directories of the 
applications respective name.  There you will find the .m and .h files (objective-c).
